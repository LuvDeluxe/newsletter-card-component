Newsletter Card Component

Practiced creating Newsletter Card Component. 

Requirements: 
The Newsletter Card Component should have an email input field for the user to enter their email address and a subscribe button.

An email input field should be validated before the user can submit the form.

If the email address is not valid, an error alert message should be displayed to the user.

When the user clicks on the subscribe button, a success message should be displayed to the user.
Show the hover state of all the elements.

The component should be responsive and display correctly on different screen sizes.

Make this landing page look as close to the design as possible.
